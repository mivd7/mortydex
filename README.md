This is an app to explore characters and locations in the Rick and Morty multiverse, made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) . It makes use of the UI component library [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Live demo: https://mortydex-rouge.vercel.app/

## Prerequisites:
- NodeJS (preferably latest)

## How to run:
1.  ```$ npm install```
2. ```$ npm run dev```
3. The app is now running on http://localhost:3000

## Future improvements
As this was a case assignment, this app was developed in limited time and thus not all features were fully developed. Some suggestions for further improvements include:
- Make it more responsive
- Develop an actual design for the UI/UX using design software (like Figma)
- Create an episode overview and character overview page
- Introduce search functionality to search for character, location or episode by name
